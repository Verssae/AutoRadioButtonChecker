# Auto Radio Button Checker
This Chrome extension takes a snapshot of a page of radio buttons you have checked and automatically checks the buttons every time you access that page. This program is convenient for you when accessing a site where you have to check the radio buttons every time you visit.

## How to use
1. Pin the AutoRadioChecker extension.
2. Check all radio buttons on the page you want.
3. Click the AutoRadiChecker icon to bring up a pop-up window.
4. Click the save button to save.
   1. If the url of the page and the index of the clicked radio buttons are displayed, it is good.
5. Each time you visit this page, the radio buttons will be checked as you just clicked.
6. If you want to change the list of checked buttons, simply check it again and hit the save button.
7. If you have a page that you no longer want to automatically check, just hit the x button in the list.
